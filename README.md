# HomePay

HomePay is a rental payment app where a tenant can add a rental property and owner bank details and pay rent online through a debit or credit card. After several rent payments, a rental credit score will be generated, which depends on several factors, such as on-time payments, rent amount, and rental period. 

The rental credit score will be the core of the application upon which other services will be provided. It can be seen as a badge of trust built by on-time payments and previous rental history that can be shared with new owners and convince them to give their property on rent and even reduce security deposit.
